S390X JIT Backend
=================

Our JIT implements the 64 bit version of the IBM Mainframe called s390x.
Note that this architecture is big endian.

The following facilities need to be installed to operate
correctly (all of the machines used for development these where installed):

* General-Instructions-Extension
* Long-Displacement
* Binary Floating Point (IEEE)

Translating
-----------

Ensure that libffi is installed (version should do > 3.0.+).
CPython should be version 2.7.+.
